On the one hand, they mobilize a considerable number of people, among participants, diverse collaborators and assistance. On the other hand, they present themselves as excellent initiatives in science, technology and engineering. The proposed challenges promote a clear growth of the involved students in issues as diverse as the practical application of scientific knowledge or the imagination and creativity required.

                                        This is, moreover, one of the essential markers of merit of this organization, always supported by several entities that confirm the dynamism and quality of BEST Aveiro.

                                        Having already participated in previous editions, the decision to participate in the EBEC 2014 edition was mainly due to the spirit of healthy competition, with the ultimate goal of achieving EBEC Final round.  After the victory in the local round, where the competition was very disputed until the end, we went to EBEC Portugal with an heavy responsibility for representing the University of Aveiro. We never gave up, and we did an excellent team work, making use of all the knowledge transmitted by both the workshops and the companies which were present at the event, we succeeded!
                                        Arriving at the International stage is like a dream coming true: to represent the University of Aveiro in an European competition! It was an unforgettable experience, both in the competitive field and in professional and personal experience. We were in contact with reputed international companies and, above all, we learnt from them and from all participants of different nationalities!<br/>
                                        To summarize, participating in EBEC is a very rewarding and enriching experience that improves us as individuals and as professionals!

                                        Participating as a jury of the "Team Design" of EBEC Portugal 2015 was a real pleasure. As a professor of Physical Engineering course at the University of Aveiro I am always very satisfied when I see young people working as a team to solve engineering problems. The competition allowed them to put into practice the previously acquired knowledge during their academic education, in an environment which provides a true team spirit focused on problem solving, as you will find in your future professional career. The solutions presented, studied and realized "non-stop" against the clock and with limited resources, demonstrated the capacities of reasoning, technique and invention of the competitors, both individually and as a team. Congratulations EBEC Aveiro and I‚Äôm looking forward for the next edition, because events like this are essential for strengthening the future innovative business of the country.
